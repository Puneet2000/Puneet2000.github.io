I am a final year Computer Science Undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) and member of [Machine Learning and Vision Group](https://lab1055.github.io/), headed by [Dr. Vineeth Balasubramaninan](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/index.html). I have around 2+ years of research experience in Computer Vision. During these years, I worked as a Summer Research Intern at Adobe MDSR Labs, Noida for two consecutive years (2019-2020) and have been involved in many deep learning projects, which have been published in following [conferences and workshops](https://puneet2000.github.io//publications/). I have also served as reviewer/subreviewer for following [conferences and journals](https://puneet2000.github.io/service/). My current research area/interest includes *Generative Adversarial Networks, Adversarial Machine Learning, Uncertainty, Few-Shot/Zero-Shot learning, and Interpretable Machine Learning*. 
I am actively looking for research collaborations and interactive opportunities in Machine/Deep Learning conferences/schools/events. Among other things, I am a binge-watcher, music and a food lover.
