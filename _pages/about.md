Hi everyone! I am Puneet Mangla, a final year Computer Science Undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). I work at [Machine Learning and Vision Group of IITH](https://lab1055.github.io/) headed by [Dr. Vineeth Balasubramaninan](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/index.html) and have around 2+ years of research experience in Computer Vision. I also worked as a Summer Research Intern at Adobe MDSR Labs, Noida for two consecutive years (2019-2020). In these years, I have been involved in many deep learning projects, most of which have been published in *prestigious conferences and workshops*. The working of the human brain fascinates me, and to come up with novel ideas, I try to think about them from a deep learning perspective. I like to hone my research skills by reviewing and giving input to other's work. I have been a considerate reviewer/subreviewer for several *conferences (WACV 2020, ICML 2020, ECCV 2020) and journals (IEEE TNNS 2020)*. My current research area/interest includes *Generative Adversarial Networks, Adversarial Machine Learning, Uncertainty, Few-Shot/Zero-Shot learning, and Interpretable Machine Learning*. I am actively looking for research collaborations and interactive opportunities in Machine/Deep Learning conferences/schools/events. 

Among other things, I am a binge-watcher, music and a food lover.
